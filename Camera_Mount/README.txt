# Summary

After recently making an OctoPi to control my TAZ 6 and looking at the timelapse footage of my prints I realised I needed the camera mounted to the bed to properly see what was going on so I made this mount.

It is designed to mount on the front left corner (where the nozzle cleaner is) and fits around the auto bed levelling mount. It gets very close to the fan mounts on the extruder but does not touch them. The reason it is so close is that I built an enclosure without much y axis space and it needed it to not hit the acrylic front and this way it juuuuust fits :)

I experimented with having the camera mount rotate but always wanted the view centred on the bed anyway and it's in an easily knockable location so just fused these two parts for less complexity. In the future I may even fuse the camera mount :)

There's currently still the big hole for the external lens but it's looking like I won't put one on anyway as the camera covers the whole bed pretty well. I may remove it in the future.

I'll be uploading some pictures once I've printed one that looks nice enough to photograph and a timelapse video once I've replaced my Pi camera.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 1:

I wanted the camera a little higher off the bed to get a better angle on prints and I also added a channel to hold the cable along the back. I've left the original short, channel-free file up in case someone prefers the compact version but I don't plan on updating it.

I had to enlarge the channel a little as it didn't end up printing well, but on the plus side now I have a timelapse of the view from this thing as my printer prints this thing:
