# Summary

Love my new Lulzbot Taz 6 but thought the spool holder was less than ideal. Being on the side it caused quite a bit of swirling filament before the tube then the tube itself swirled behind the printer. Looked quite messy and took up additional desk space.

Found this really good filament spool holder from KillaCycle that looked great - the style matches the printer well, it's centered over itself to keep the weight of the spool even over the base, etc. However, I found that it was a bit short as the print head would hit the spool on my Taz 6 at it's highest. I also wanted something a bit easy to "drop in" filament (instead of pulling tube in/out) and secure spool better. So I remixed (but tried to keep as much of the original design)

1. Taller Spool Holder - Filament Spool never goes below frame
2. Drop In Spool - Spool can be lifted and dropped into the holder without pulling the tube in/out (also prevents printer vibration from wiggling the tube out and dropping the spool onto the print head/bed)
3. Base Twist Snaps into Rail - For a better, more snug fit
4. Zip-tie Secure - I wanted it to be extra secure so added groves to zip tie the spool holder to the frame

Really happy about how this turned out, you can still use two of them to mount two spools if desired.

Only change I would make to this... Print in Lulzbot Green :(  (Why oh why didn't I have this color on hand??)

You have to tilt the frame and twist it into the groove carefully to get the lip to fit underneath

Use zip ties in the grooves (or screws as the original design had) for a more secure mount
