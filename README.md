# Filament
So far on Cura 2.6.63 we have had the best success with default "PLA Verbatim" settings.
Good recycled filament is sold by [filamentive](http://www.filamentive.com/). There is a discount if you send used spools back. This was Â£133 for 8 spools!
Otherwise, PLA from [E3D](https://e3d-online.com/) is good.


# Maintenance
Some good guides are written by LulzBot. Maintenance guide [here](https://www.lulzbot.com/maintaining-your-3d-printer) and specific guides  [here](https://ohai.lulzbot.com/group/maintenance-repairs/)

So far we have needed to:
- Swap wiper pad
- tighten x axis belt
- level x axis
